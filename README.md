# Sharp Memory Display Breakout Board for LS012B7DD01

The purpose of this board is to provide a near-drop-in low-power display replacement for the popular SSD1306 128x32 OLED.

It is meant to be used in wireless ergo split keyboards such as the [sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) and [corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).
